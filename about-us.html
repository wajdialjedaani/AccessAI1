            <h2>Why Accessibility Matters</h2>
            <p>
                Accessibility is not just a technical issue—it's a matter of social justice and human rights. 
                Millions of people around the world face barriers in accessing digital content and services 
                due to disabilities, impairments, or limitations. By championing accessibility with AI ethics, 
                we strive to dismantle these barriers and create a more inclusive and equitable society where 
                everyone can fully participate, contribute, and thrive.
